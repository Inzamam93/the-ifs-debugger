## Adding a New Blog Post

1. Create a new folder under `/articles/` with a descriptive slug
   e.g. `/articles/ifs-projection-apis-complete-reference/`
2. Add an `index.html` inside that folder using the post template
3. Update `sitemap.xml` with the new URL
4. Commit and push — GitHub Pages deploys automatically

---

## Setup & Deployment

This site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** — free, zero configuration.

1. Push to the `main` branch
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Branch: main / root**
3. Site is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/the-ifs-debugger`
4. Add custom domain in Pages settings for `theifsdebugger.com`
